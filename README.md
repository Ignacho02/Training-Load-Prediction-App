# Training-Load-Prediction-App
The aim of this project is to design and implement a predictive model, along with an application, that minimizes the discrepancy between the prescribed external training load and the actual load experienced by football players. By addressing this gap, the project seeks to enhance training monitoring, optimize performance, and reduce injury risk.
